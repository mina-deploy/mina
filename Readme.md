# Mina

Really fast deployer and server automation tool.

Mina works really fast because it's a deploy Bash script generator. It
generates an entire procedure as a Bash script and runs it remotely in the
server.

Compare this to the likes of Vlad or Capistrano, where each command
is ran separately on their own SSH sessions. Mina only creates *one* SSH
session per deploy, minimizing the SSH connection overhead.

    $ gem install mina
    $ mina

User guide
==========

Setting up a project
--------------------

Let's deploy a project using Mina.

### Step 1: Create a config/deploy.rb

In your project, type `mina init` to create a sample of this file.

    $ mina init
    Created config/deploy.rb.

This is just a Rake file with tasks! See [About deploy.rb](#about-deployrb) for 
more info on what *deploy.rb* is. You will want to at least configure your
server:

~~~ ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :user, 'username'
set :domain, 'your.server.com'
set :deploy_to, '/var/www/flipstack.com'
...
~~~

### Step 2: Set up your server

Make a directory in your server called `/var/www/flipstack.com` (in *deploy_to*)
change it's ownership to the correct user.

    $ ssh username@your.server.com

    # Once in your server, create the deploy folder:
    ~@your.server.com$ mkdir /var/www/flipstack.com
    ~@your.server.com$ chown -R username /var/www/flipstack.com

### Step 3: Run 'mina setup'

Back at your computer, do `mina setup` to set up the [folder 
structure](#directory-structure) in this path. This will connect to your server 
via SSH and create the right directories.

    $ mina setup
    -----> Creating folders... done.

See [directory structure](#directory-structure) for more info.

### Step 4: Deploy!

Use `mina deploy` to run the `deploy` task defined in *config/deploy.rb*.

    $ mina deploy
    -----> Deploying to 2012-06-12-040248
           ...
           Lots of things happening...
           ...
    -----> Done.

About deploy.rb
---------------

The file `deploy.rb` is simply a Rakefile invoked by Rake. In fact, `mina` is
mostly an alias that invokes Rake to load `deploy.rb`.

~~~ ruby
# Sample config/deploy.rb
set :domain, 'your.server.com'

task :restart do
  queue 'sudo service restart apache'
end
~~~

As it's all Rake, you can define tasks that you can invoke using `mina`. In this
example, it provides the `mina restart` command.

The magic of Mina is in the new commands it gives you.

The `queue` command queues up Bash commands to be ran on the remote server.
If you invoke `mina restart`, it will invoke the task above and run the queued
commands on the remote server `your.server.com` via SSH.

See [the command queue](#the-command-queue) for more information on the *queue*
command.

The command queue
-----------------

At the heart of it, Mina is merely sugar on top of Rake to queue commands
and execute them remotely at the end. Take a look at this minimal *deploy.rb*
configuration:

~~~ ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :user, 'john'
set :domain, 'flipstack.com'

task :logs do
  queue 'echo "Contents of the log file are as follows:"'
  queue "tail -f /var/log/apache.log"
end
~~~

Once you type `mina logs` in your terminal, it invokes the *queue*d commands
remotely on the server using the command `ssh john@flipstack.com`.

~~~ sh
$ mina logs --simulate
# Execute the following commands via
# ssh john@flipstack.com:
#
echo "Contents of the log file are as follows:"
tail -f /var/log/apache.log
~~~

Subtasks
--------

Mina provides the helper `invoke` to invoke other tasks from a
task.

~~~ ruby
# config/deploy.rb
task :down do
  invoke :maintenance_on
  invoke :restart
end

task :maintenance_on
  queue 'touch maintenance.txt'
end

task :restart
  queue 'sudo service restart apache'
end
~~~

In this example above, if you type `mina down`, it simply invokes the other
subtasks which queues up their commands. The commands will be ran after
everything.

Directory structure
-------------------

The deploy procedures make the assumption that you have a folder like so:

    /var/www/flipstack.com/     # The deploy_to path
     |-  releases/              # Holds releases, one subdir per release
     |   |- 1/
     |   |- 2/
     |   |- 3/
     |   '- ...
     |-  shared/                # Holds files shared between releases
     |   |- logs/               # Log files are usually stored here
     |   `- ...
     '-  current/               # A symlink to the current release in releases/

It also assumes that the `deploy_to` path is fully writeable/readable for the
user we're going to SSH with.

Deploying
---------

Mina provides the `deploy` command which *queue*s up a deploy script for
you.

~~~ ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :domain, 'flipstack.com'
set :user, 'flipstack'
set :deploy_to, '/var/www/flipstack.com'
set :repository, 'http://github.com/flipstack/flipstack.git'

task :deploy do
  deploy do
    # Put things that prepare the empty release folder here.
    # Commands queued here will be ran on a new release directory.
    invoke :'git:clone'
    invoke :'bundle:install'

    # These are instructions to start the app after it's been prepared.
    to :launch do
      queue 'touch tmp/restart.txt'
    end

    # This optional block defines how a broken release should be cleaned up.
    to :clean do
      queue 'log "failed deployment"'
    end
  end
end
~~~

It works by capturing the *queue*d commands inside the block, wrapping them
in a deploy script, then *queue*ing them back in.

### How deploying works

Here is an example of a deploy! (Note that some commands have been simplified
to illustrate the point better.)

### Step 1: Build it

The deploy process builds a new temp folder with instructions you provide.
In this example, it will do `git:clone` and `bundle:install`.

    $ mina deploy --verbose
    -----> Creating the build path
           $ mkdir tmp/build-128293482394
    -----> Cloning the Git repository
           $ git clone https://github.com/flipstack/flipstack.git . -n --recursive
           Cloning... done.
    -----> Installing gem dependencies using Bundler
           $ bundle install --without development:test
           Using i18n (0.6.0)
           Using multi_json (1.0.4)
           ...
           Your bundle is complete! It was installed to ./vendor/bundle

### Step 2: Move it to releases

Once the project has been built, it will be moved to `releases/`. A symlink
called `current/` will be created to point to the active release.

    $
    -----> Moving to releases/4
           $ mv "./tmp/build-128293482394" "releases/4"
    -----> Symlinking to current
           $ ln -nfs releases/4 current

### Step 3: Launch it

Invoke the commands queued up in the `to :launch` block. These often
commands to restart the webserver process. Once this in complete, you're done!

    $
    -----> Launching
           $ cd releases/4
           $ sudo service nginx restart
    -----> Done. Deployed v4

### What about failure?

If it fails at any point, the release path will be deleted. If any commands are
queued using the `to :clean` block, they will be ran. It will be as if nothing
happened. Lets see what happens if a build fails:

    $
    -----> Launching
           $ cd releases/4
           $ sudo service nginx restart
           Starting nginx... error: can't start service
    -----> ERROR: Deploy failed.
    -----> Cleaning up build
           $ rm -rf tmp/build-128293482394
    -----> Unlinking current
           $ ln -nfs releases/3 current
           OK

Command line options
--------------------

Basic usage:

    $ mina [OPTIONS] [TASKS] [VAR1=val VAR2=val ...]

### Options

* `-v` / `--verbose` - This will show commands being done on the server. Off by
  default.

* `-S` / `--simulate` - This will not invoke any SSH connections; instead, it
  will simply output the script it builds.

* `-t` / `--trace` - Show backtraces when errors occur.

* `-f FILE` - Use a custom deploy.rb configuration.

* `-V` / `--version` - Shows the current version.

### Tasks

There are many tasks available. See the [tasks reference](tasks/index.html), or 
type `mina tasks`.

### Variables

You may specify additional variables in the `KEY=value` style, just like Rake.
You can add as many variables as needed.

    $ mina restart on=staging

    # This sets the ENV['on'] variable to 'staging'.


# Helpers

### invoke

puts erb('foo.erb')
#=> "1 and 2"
~~~

Returns the output string of the ERB template.

### run!

This is already automatically invoked before Rake exits to run all
commands that have been queued up.

~~~ ruby
queue "sudo restart"
run!
~~~

Returns nothing.

### report_time
Report time elapsed in the block.
Returns the output of the block.

end
to :launch do
  run "nginx -s restart"
end
commands(:prepare) == ["bundle install"]
