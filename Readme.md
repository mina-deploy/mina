Really fast deployer and server automation tool.

## Warning

**This is a readme of the current master, version 1.0.0. If you are using older mina (pre 0.3) please take a look at [0.3 readme](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina/blob/v0.3.8/Readme.md)**


Mina works really fast because it's a deploy Bash script generator. It
generates an entire procedure as a Bash script and runs it remotely in the
server.

Compare this to the likes of [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano), where it opens an SSH connection and runs each command in sequence
, Mina only creates a SSH session and sends *one* command.

    $ gem install mina
    $ mina init

Mina requires ruby 2.0.0 or greater. For older please use [0.3.8 version](https://github.com/mina-deploy/mina/blob/v0.3.8/)
